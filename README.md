# jccompmod
Archived project that adds several new companions into Minecraft Java 1.20.1 Forge.

Originally dubbed JuiceCraft, this mod overhauls the existing concept of companion mods by vastly upgrading the A.I. packages involved and adding new interesting progression mechanics made with vanilla balancing in mind. The differentiating features of JuiceCraft as opposed to other mods such as KemonoCraft or similar include: dialogue functions, memory logs, intuitive relationship systems, complex skills, polished animations, and hand-designed behavioral modules that adds life-like habits and tendencies.

Completely dependency free and should have compatibility with almost everything that doesn't use aggressive mixins. There may be some behavioral differences due to the different pathfinding system that was implemented, along with several significant physics and rendering changes made to account for the high fidelity models/textures that the base system did not support.

The project is currently on hold but is technically in a playable state; minor bugs still exist due to the complexity of the mod and the main generation of companions has not yet been completed.
